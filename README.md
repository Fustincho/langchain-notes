# LangChain Notes

This repository will contain Jupyter notebooks with notes about LangChain's usage.

The requirements.txt file contains the most up-to-date versions of LangChain for notebooks run in this repo. However, for consistency and due to the rapid changes in the library, each notebook will print at the top the versions of the library that were used to create the notebook.

Different providers (e.g., AzureOpenAI, Bedrock) will be organized into separate folders for clarity.

I will try to keep the information up to date, as it also encourages me to stay current with LangChain's development. Stay tuned for updates and insights!
